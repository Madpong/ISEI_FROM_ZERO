How to setup Unity with Github properly (en)
===

I've tried to pick up the basics to get github and unity working so I don't have file and compatibility problems. 

I'm sorry if my English isn't very good. I hope everything is understood. 

I've created both a giff and a text version in case you don't understand something. I hope you find it helpful!



We need:

- A Github account
- Add the rest of the people to the repository
- Download GithubDesktop
- Log in with our Github account on GithubDesktop
- Clone the ISEI Repository from the Github repo
- Open unity with the ISEI-MAIN.unity file in the Assets folder

## Text Guide

1. After creating the account and have githubDesktop installed go to File > clone repository

2. Select the ISEI repository

3. Select the download location and click clone.



This will take a while. What's happening here, is that it's connecting to the github "like a folder in cloud" repository. And downloading all the files as is on your computer.

# Primer Inicio Unity

Once you're done, go to the folder where you downloaded it:

1. In the Assets folder open the file ISEI-MAIN.unity
 This will open up the Unity project for you. The first time it will take quite a while because all those files we have mentioned before have to be created again. But this will only do it the first time.
3. When I'm done, Tadah! Unity's project is ready. You can start working on it now. 

# Code and Upload!

Now comes the sharing part and it requires some more understanding but not much. This is done by GithubDesktop, let's say it's a gossiping program that is checking all the time what changes and doesn't change while you use any program in that folder, in our case Unity. 

Let's say you're creating a mechanism. You create your script... tests... bugs... and after a while you've got it working. Then it's time to update the general code! How do you do that?

1. Let's go to GithubDesktop.
2. We look for our Repository. In our case ISEI.
3. Look at the tab in the upper left where it says Changes.
4. We check that these are the changes we have made
5. If they are right then we go to the bottom left. And here we add a text that represents that we have changed. For example, if we have created an attack mechanic. I'd put "Main Character Atack" or something like that
6. Once you have posted your comment, click on Commit to master. This will tell githubDesktop which files to update in the "github cloud".
7. When you are done we just need to tell you to upload them to the cloud directory. By pressing the blue button ``Push to Origin``.
8. That's it! All should be updated in the cloud by now, this will also tell you when there are changes from another person to update your files in your computer!

I hope it works! and it helps you!
